# _Domain Modeling Made Functional_… 4⨉ over

I'm an nerd. So my "fun learning project" to start the year is: working through
the exercise section of Scott Wlaschin's (_really_ excellent) _Domain Modeling
Made Functional_… in four different languages I'm interested in:

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)
* [Elm](http://elm-lang.org)
* [F#](http://fsharp.org)
* [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io)

These all have something of a family resemblance: all are descended more or less
directly from [Standard ML](http://smlnj.org/sml.html). So it's not like it's a
_super_ crazy thing. They're also all languages I have active interest in, and
_some_ degree of prior familiarity with, so it's not crazy in that regard. But
they're also all just enough different from each other (from where they run to
how they're built) to make the project interesting.
